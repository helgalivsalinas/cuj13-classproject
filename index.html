An illegal gang member shot three students in Newark, New Jersey, execution style. He was free on bail and was facing charges of aggravated assault and sexual abuse of a child at the time of the murders. Another illegal immigrant was arrested after DNA matched him to a series of rapes of teenage girls in Chandler, Arizona. Sadly, I could go on and on, remembering thousands of victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. They are a reminder that we need to enforce all of our immigration laws to prevent these crimes from happening. This means enforcing our work site laws against employers and illegal workers, supporting local law enforcement agencies who want to arrest illegal immigrants, and passing a long-term reauthorization of E-Verify, the Federal Government's program that helps employers hire legal workers. <em>From "Enforce Immigration to Prevent Crimes" on May 6, 2009 by Lamar Smith of Texas</em></span>"y , '' Bob Clark , was killed by an <em>illegal</em> immigrant drunk driver in Los Angel</a></p>

			<p><a id="info"><span>Madam Speaker, during a routine traffic stop, an illegal immigrant named Juan Leonardo Quintero-Perez shot Houston Police Officer Rodney Johnson in the back of the head and killed him. This case highlights the illegal immigrant epidemic in this country. It seems, however, that Juan Quintero-Perez had already been deported before from the United States. In 1998, Quintero was arrested and convicted of indecency with a child in Texas and then was deported back to Mexico. But Perez was able to return to the United States a few months later because his employer, Robert Camp, sent money to Mexico to hire a smuggler that snuck Perez back to Houston. Camp knew that Quintero-Perez was an illegal immigrant and a criminal, but Camp hired him again anyway. Camp even rented a home for Quintero-Perez, and then Perez murdered Officer Johnson. Those who knowingly hire and house illegal immigrants, all in the name of making a little money, should go to jail. Rodney Johnson's blood is on the hands of the employer who brought the illegal outlaw back to the United States. <em>From "Employers Who Hire Illegals" on Jan. 16, 2008 by Ted Poe of Texas</em></span>amp knew that Quintero-Perez was an <em>illegal</em> immigrant and a criminal , but Camp</a></p>

			<p><a id="info"><span> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4134, a bill that would merely allow the States to decide, rather than the Federal Government, whether to provide a free public education, deny public education, or charge tuition to illegal aliens. This does not apply to illegal aliens currently enrolled, or those who enroll prior to July 1, 1997. I support this legislation despite my personal reservations regarding the wisdom of denying public education to illegal immigrants. Some argue that this is not the best approach to combating illegal immigration, and that denying education to illegal immigrant children will in the long run have the unintended consequence of perpetuating the influx of an illegal immigrant underclass within our society. I have been assured by New York Governor George Pataki that New York will continue to choose to provide a free public education to illegal immigrant children. But what is really at issue here is who should decide whether a State educates illegal aliens within its State borders, the States, or the Federal Government. The public education of illegal immigrants is a tremendous unfunded mandate on the States. <em>From "Authorizing States to Deny Public Education Benefits to Certain Aliens Not Lawfully Present in the United States" on Sept. 25, 1996 by Rick Lazio from New York</em></span>sdom of denying public education to <em>illegal</em> immigrants.

			<p><a id="info"><span>Unfortunately, a recent tragedy in my home district in southeastern North Carolina makes clear the need for strengthening our immigration laws in this type of situation. On July 16, Scott Gardner, a constituent of Mrs. Myrick, was killed in my district while traveling with his family to go to the beach on vacation. He was killed by a drunk driver, an illegal immigrant who should never have been in this country in the first place, not just because he came here illegally, but because he had already broken the law three times and was still in our country. Prior to killing Scott Gardner, this illegal alien had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on three separate occasions. But rather than being deported for breaking the law a third time, this illegal immigrant was sentenced to just 30 days in jail and then released back into society. The tragedy the Gardner family experienced personifies the need for expanding efforts to stop illegal immigration and improve our border control. It is time to send a clear message to those who would break our laws and put our Nation's citizens at risk. <em>From "Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005" on Dec. 16, 2005 by Mike McIntyre from North Carolina</em></span>ior to killing Scott Gardner , this <em>illegal</em> alien had been charged with driving</a></p>

			<p><a id="info"><span>Mr. President, last week I introduced a bill to control illegal immigration and protect U.S. jobs. I would like to take a few minutes to expand on that bill. Last year, Congress passed landmark immigration reform legislation intended to curb illegal immigration. But that Republican legislation addressed only half of the illegal immigration problem. Republicans did not get the job done. So today, with the support of our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, I introduce legislation to address the unfinished business of controlling illegal immigration. Immigration experts, policy think tanks, and blue-ribbon commissions over the past two decades all agree that effective enforcement against illegal immigration requires two steps. We must stop people from crossing our borders illegally. But, we must also combine our border enforcement efforts with effective workplace enforcement to deter employers who hire illegal workers. <em> From "Controlling Illegal Immigration and Protecting Jobs" on Jan. 28, 1997 by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts</em></span>week I introduced a bill to control <em>illegal</em> immigration and protect U.S. jobs.</a></p>

			<p><a id="info"><span>The Clinton administration should be commended for their aggressive enforcement strategy at the border. By the end of this year, the Clinton administration plans to have increased the Border Patrol from under 4,000 agents in 1993 to 6,859 agents--a 73-percent increase. And last year's immigration bill reenforced this increase by authorizing an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents for each of the next 3 years. In addition, last year's immigration bill contained new, stiff penalties against the crime syndicates that smuggle illegal immigrant workers into the United States. But Republicans neglected the second key element of a successful immigration enforcement strategy, which is workplace enforcement to deny jobs to illegal immigrant workers. There is one reason, and one reason only, that illegal immigrants come to America: to find jobs. Last year's Republican immigration bill did almost nothing to address this problem. We will never reduce illegal immigration significantly until we shut off the job magnet that draws illegal immigrants to this country. <em> From "Controlling Illegal Immigration and Protecting Jobs" on Jan. 28, 1997 by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts</em></span>rcement to deter employers who hire <em>illegal</em> workers.

			<p><a id="info"><span>The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that at least 40 percent, and possibly half, of the illegal immigrant population in the United States actually entered the country legally, but stayed on and worked illegally after their visas expired. They came here originally as tourists or students, but overstayed their visas and are now illegally taking American jobs. No amount of border enforcement will stop this major source of illegal immigrant workers. They arrive at our airports and at our borders with genuine passports and visas. There is no way to know that their real plans are to stay and work illegally...Rather than just beefing up our Border Patrol, we must also increase the capacity of the Immigration Service and the Department of Labor to protect American jobs by finding illegal immigrants in the workplace and prosecuting unscrupulous employers who hire and abuse them. In 1986, Congress made it illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrant workers. But today it is far too easy for these workers to pose as legal immigrant workers or even U.S. citizens by using false documents.<em> From "Controlling Illegal Immigration and Protecting Jobs" on Jan. 28, 1997 by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts</em></span>ercent , and possibly half , of the <em>illegal</em> immigrant population in the United</a></p>

 			<p><a id="info"><span>Madam President, I was truly disappointed to learn that Senator Reid intends to bring up a new version of the sweeping amnesty proposal, known as the DREAM Act. Disguised as an educational initiative, the DREAM Act will provide a powerful incentive for more illegal immigration by granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. The bill, which is unaffordable for taxpayers in many different ways, is a bad idea and comes at the worst possible time. As of recently, there are now plenty different versions of the DREAM Act on the legislative calendar, with different moving parts and revisions, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter which one you focus on; they all have the same core, which is amnesty for a significant number of illegal aliens.<em>From "DREAM Act" on Dec. 2, 2010 by David Vitter (R.) from Louisiana</em></span>by granting amnesty to millions of <em>illegal</em> aliens.

In these difficult economic times, it is an insult to legal, tax-paying citizens that President Obama and his allies in the Senate want to use their hard-earned money to pay for educational benefits for illegal aliens. The struggling economy has increased the demand for enrollment in public universities, as a growing number of families are unable to afford other education. At a time when many Americans cannot afford to send their own children to college, this bill would clearly allow the government to provide Federal student loans to illegal aliens who will displace legal residents competing for taxpayer subsidies. I am opposed to this proposal because it would unfairly place American citizens in direct competition with illegal aliens for scarce slots in classes at State colleges. <em>From "DREAM Act" on Dec. 2, 2010 by David Vitter (R.) from Louisiana</em></span>to pay for educational benefits for <em>illegal</em> aliens.

Among these students you will find valedictorians, honor roll students, and community leaders who are committed to the United States and their local communities. It is estimated that there are 65,000 such young people who graduate from high school in the United States and find themselves unable to work, go to college, or serve this country in the military. <em>From "The DREAM Act" on Sept. 23, 2010 by Benjamin Cardin (D.) of Maryland</em></span>ime debating what to do with the <em>undocumented</em> adults who have come to the U.S.</a></p>
