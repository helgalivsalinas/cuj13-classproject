# cuj13-classproject
For my computational journalism class at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.

I built this to supplement my master's project, which focuses on the undocumented student movement. Much of the movement has focused on their representation in the media, especially via language. Most notably, the focus was on using the word “illegal immigrant” versus “undocumented.” The argument being that “illegal immigrant” dehumanizes the person, has a negative connotation, and criminalizes the person, not the act. It suggests as if their primary purpose was to break the law. “Undocumented” moves away from that perception to simply people living and working not with the intention of breaking laws/taking jobs away from Americans/draining the welfare system. 

So, for my final project, I would like to look at text of news articles, specifically the New York Times, to see how they use “illegal” or “undocumented.” 

Also, the undocumented population has been associated with Latinos, making the use of “illegal” or “undocumented’ also have political consequences, especially during the presidential election last year.
